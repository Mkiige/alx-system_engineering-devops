# Issue Summary:

Duration: February 25, 2023, from 9:00 PM to February 26, 2023, 3:00 AM (UTC-5)

Impact: Our web application had a "connection crisis," leaving users hanging for six long hours. Users were experiencing HTTP 500 errors, and we estimate that around 95% of them were affected. This outage was like a terrible blind date, leaving our users wondering if they should stick around or swipe left.

Root Cause: Like a bad date, we couldn't seem to close our connections properly. A database connection leak caused a resource exhaustion condition that eventually brought the system down.

# Timeline:

* February 25, 2023, 9:00 PM: Our monitoring system starts getting a little too friendly and alerts the on-call engineer about the sudden increase in HTTP 500 errors.
* February 25, 2023, 9:05 PM: The engineer starts investigating the issue and realizes we have a connection crisis on our hands - the web app can't seem to connect to the database server.
* February 25, 2023, 9:15 PM: The engineer tries to mend the situation by restarting the database server - alas, this doesn't turn out to be the fix we were looking for.
* February 25, 2023, 9:20 PM: The engineer receives another alert, signaling that the issue is still very much alive and kicking.
* February 25, 2023, 9:30 PM: The engineer finds the real problem - we couldn't close our connections properly. They attempt to kill the connections manually to no avail.
* February 25, 2023, 10:00 PM: The incident is starting to get out of hand - we have to escalate to the database team.
* February 25, 2023, 10:30 PM: The database team swoops in, identifying the issue with the connection pool and deploying a fix to the production environment.
* February 26, 2023, 1:00 AM: Like a knight in shining armor, the database team slays the connection dragon and fixes the connection leak.
* February 26, 2023, 3:00 AM: The monitoring system reports that the crisis has been averted, and we can all breathe a sigh of relief - users can now access the web app.
# Root Cause and Resolution:

The connection crisis was caused by a database connection leak that led to the connection pool becoming exhausted, rendering any new connections impossible. The leak was a result of a bug in the application code that wasn't closing database connections correctly.

To fix the problem, the database team got to work on the code, closing the connections properly, and optimizing the database server configuration to ensure efficient use of the connection pool.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

We're not taking any chances with our users' hearts - we're taking the following measures to prevent similar crises in the future:

* We'll do a thorough review of the application code to identify and fix any potential connection leaks.
* We'll implement a more stringent connection pool management policy to prevent any further exhaustion conditions.
* We'll enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities to quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.
* We'll schedule regular load testing to identify and mitigate performance issues before they can harm our users.
* We'll establish a formal incident response plan to ensure that any future incidents are handled in a timely and effective manner.
# TODOs:

* Conduct a code review to identify and fix any potential connection leaks.
* Update the connection pool management policy to prevent any further exhaustion conditions.
* Enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities to quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.
* Schedule regular load testing to identify and mitigate performance issues before they impact users.
* Establish a formal incident response plan to ensure a timely and effective response to any future incidents.
