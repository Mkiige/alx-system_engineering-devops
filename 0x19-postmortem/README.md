# Issue Summary:

Duration: February 25, 2023, from 9:00 PM to February 26, 2023, 3:00 AM (UTC-5)

Impact: The web application was down, and users were unable to access any of the functionalities. The users were experiencing HTTP 500 errors, and approximately 95% of the users were affected.

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a database connection leak that led to a resource exhaustion condition.

# Timeline:

* February 25, 2023, 9:00 PM: The monitoring system alerted the on-call engineer about the sudden increase in HTTP 500 errors.
* February 25, 2023, 9:05 PM: The engineer investigated the issue and found that the web application was unable to connect to the database server.
* February 25, 2023, 9:15 PM: The engineer restarted the database server, and the issue seemed to be resolved.
* February 25, 2023, 9:20 PM: The engineer received another alert, indicating that the issue was still present.
* February 25, 2023, 9:30 PM: The engineer realized that there was a database connection leak that was causing the resource exhaustion.
* February 25, 2023, 9:35 PM: The engineer attempted to kill the database connections manually to mitigate the issue.
* February 25, 2023, 10:00 PM: The engineer escalated the incident to the database team.
* February 25, 2023, 10:30 PM: The database team analyzed the issue and found that the database connection pool was not being closed correctly, leading to the connection leak.
* February 26, 2023, 1:00 AM: The database team fixed the connection leak and deployed the fix to the production environment.
* February 26, 2023, 3:00 AM: The monitoring system confirmed that the issue was resolved, and the incident was closed.
# Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a database connection leak that caused the connection pool to become exhausted, preventing any new connections from being made. The leak was caused by a bug in the application code that was not closing database connections correctly.

To resolve the issue, the database team fixed the connection leak by updating the application code to close connections properly. They also optimized the database server configuration to ensure that the connection pool was being used efficiently.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

* Conduct a comprehensive review of the application code to identify and fix any other potential connection leaks.
* Implement a stricter connection pool management policy to prevent resource exhaustion conditions.
* Increase monitoring and alerting capabilities to quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.
* Conduct regular load testing to identify and mitigate performance issues before they impact users.
* Establish a formal incident response plan to ensure a timely and effective response to any future incidents.

# TODOs:

* Conduct a code review to identify and fix any other potential connection leaks.
* Update the connection pool management policy to prevent resource exhaustion conditions.
* Enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities to quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.
* Schedule regular load testing to identify and mitigate performance issues before they impact users.
* Establish a formal incident response plan to ensure a timely and effective response to any future incidents.
